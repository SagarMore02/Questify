# POINTS TO REMEMBER (Guidelines)
1. Always (/git pull origin/) developing before pushing your changes

2. Always send a pull request and merge your branch with developing
(As Everyone is pulling from developing late merging will result in conflicts)

3. Always delete a branch after merging with developing branch

4. Never accept your own merge request if someone is pushes to developing before you it might be overwritten

5. Always Delete local branches after merging with developing branch do not leave a floating local branch
(to delete a branch be present at its parent branch) (/git branch -d branch_name/)

6. Create small branches with small changes and frequently merge it and incase of no work done merge the branch
(Please do not leave floating branches when pc off or not working) (merge branches for every small work done)

7. There is no need to work directly on branches you can create a branch directly when you try and fix a code on your local machine
